# Incorrect Null Handling in JavaScript Function

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in JavaScript related to null and undefined value handling. The `foo` function attempts to add two numbers but only explicitly checks for null values, ignoring undefined values. This can lead to unexpected behavior and errors. The solution demonstrates how to correctly handle both null and undefined inputs for more robust code.

## Bug

The original `foo` function in `bug.js` only checks for `null` values and fails to account for `undefined` inputs, which could result in errors (e.g., `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '+')`).

## Solution

The corrected function in `bugSolution.js` addresses this issue by explicitly checking for both `null` and `undefined` inputs, ensuring the function behaves correctly in all cases.
